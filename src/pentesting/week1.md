# Week 1 of Penetration Testing

## Welcome to Penetration Testing (pentesting)

This week is about setting up our important tools and ensuring that they work.

**Monday**: Installing our hypervisor and VM. You will need VMware Workstation or Fusion, a Kali Linux VM, and a Try Hack Me account.

**Tuesday**: Trying out our VM to do some basic recon work. We will complete a Try Hack Me room together and experiment with cloud-based labs.

**Thursday**: Trying out our VM to do some basic vulnerability exploits. We will try a more advanced THM room.

**Friday**: Cyber Kill Chain and some OSINT recon tools.
